What to work on?
================

So you've read the blast developer guide, now you want to know what exactly to
work on. The best place to start is the
`issues <https://github.com/astrophpeter/blast/issues>`_ tab on the blast github
page. Here you will find a list of develop tasks that need to be worked on for
blast. They are tagged by level of difficulty:

Entry level
-----------

These issues are tagged with :code:`Difficulty: entry level`. These issues are
self-contained short tasks that often require only editing html or documentation
rst files. These issues will often have specific instructions on how to complete
them. These issues are a great place to start for new developers.

Intermediate
------------

These issues are tagged with :code:`Difficulty: intermediate`. These issues are
slightly longer tasks which require editing python code with blast. You may have
to write tests to get work on these issues through code review. The issue will
often have some direction on how to complete the feature request, but you will
have to figure out specific implementation details. These issues are great for
developers who have some experience with python and / or have completed
a few entry level issues.

Advanced
--------

These issues are tagged with :code:`Difficulty: advanced`. These issues are
open-ended tasks which often require knowledge of all aspects of the application,
or involve project level structural changes. These issues are great for
developers who are confident with python and django and have completed
many intermediate level issues.


You are now ready to get stuck in, pick an issue and good luck! :-)
