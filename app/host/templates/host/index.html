                    The host galaxies of astrophysical transients play a key role in our
                    understanding of their progenitor systems and the use of Type Ia
                    supernovae as standardizable candles for cosmology. However, fully
                    characterizing host galaxy environments requires a high-statistics, unbiased,
                    multiwavelength dataset, preferably with 1-2 kpc resolution. Current analyses
                   are limited by sample sizes of anywhere from âˆ¼10-200 SNe, predominantly
                   optical host observations, and observational biases such as selecting from
                   surveys that search for SNe within a pre-selected a set of galaxies.

                  Blast is a public web application built to find a transinet's host
                  galaxy, identify the available
                  archival data, and measure the resulting host galaxy star formation
                  rates, masses, and stellar ages - for every new transient reported to
                  the IAU in real-time after the transient is announced. This information
                  is not provided by any existing transient broker service.
